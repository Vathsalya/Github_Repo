Buzzy's not like other bees. Other bees make lots of trips to gather their nectar.
Once upon a time there were two little kids named Jesse and Mary Sue. 
They were brother and sister.
Their mom and dad had divorced years ago.
And their dad now was seeing someone else.
She was cruel to them behind their father’s back.
She said if they got married, she would make their life’s miserable from the moment she said I do”.
One day their dad called them into his room.
When they got in there he told them to sit on the bed,then he said “there’s going to be a new member in the family and a lot of changes too.
What I’m trying to say is I’m getting married”. “What”, they said.
